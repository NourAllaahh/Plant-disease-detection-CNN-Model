## Methodolgy 

Data Gathering:
* For Plant disease detection
we used a publicly available and famous Dataset [“Plant Village Dataset”](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease)
This Dataset Contains 54,305 images of plant leaves collected under different environment Conditions
Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato. 

* For The Soil Type Detection:
we used a publicly available Dataset “Soil types Dataset.” 
This Dataset Contains images of Soil Types collected under different environment Conditions, Pictures of Soils are divided into the following: 
Black Soil, Cinder Soil, Peat Soil, Laterite Soil , Yellow Soil 

## Techniques:

Convolutional Neural Network: is a class of deep neural networks, most applied to analyzing visual imagery. its widely used in applications of image and video recognition.
